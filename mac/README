This is some code to allow Java code to monitor Mac processes natively via JNI

It registers with NSNotificationCenter as an observer for process events:
NSWorkspaceDidLaunchApplicationNotification
NSWorkspaceDidTerminateApplicationNotification

and fires off callbacks to Java when Lightroom processes are detected as starting or stopping.
